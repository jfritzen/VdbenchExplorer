This is a tool written in Groovy for plotting data from the Vdbench
disk benchmarking tool (http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdbench).

Documentation in Wikimedia format can be found in doc.

The VdbenchExplorer tool is a single Groovy script. But you also
need the JPlot library (http://jplot.sourceforge.net/), which is
not included here.
